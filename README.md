# Global Income Equality

## Introduction
**Global Income Equality** is a data-driven project aimed at understanding and addressing disparities in income distribution across countries and regions. 
 Through data analysis, visualization, and policy insights, this project seeks to promote awareness and drive action toward a more equitable global economy

## Project Overview

## Income inequality remains one of the most pressing global challenges. This project explores:
* Trends in income distribution across countries
* The impact of inequality on development, health, and education
* Policy measures and their effectiveness in reducing inequality

## Current State of Global Income Inequality
Income inequality remains a significant challenge both between and within countries.

## Factors Contributing to Income Inequality
* Globalization: While it has lifted many out of poverty, globalization has also widened the gap between the rich and the poor2.
* Technological Advancements: Automation and digitalization have disproportionately benefited those with higher skills and capital.
* Policy Decisions: Tax policies, social welfare programs, and labor laws significantly impact income distribution.

## Data Sources
The data used primarily stems from reputable international organizations, including:

* World Bank
* International Monetary Fund (IMF)
* United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
* OECD  

 ## Tools Used
* Python: Used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
* Pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: Python libraries for creating visualizations of the income distribution data.
* Jupyter Notebook: Used for coding, data exploration, and collaboration among team members.
* These organizations offer comprehensive, reliable statistics on various income indicators, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP).

* ## Analysis
* We will conduct descriptive statistics to understand the income distribution within and across countries.
* We will create visualizations, such as bar plots and heatmaps, to illustrate the income distribution patterns.
* We will compare income inequality trends over time and across countries to identify potential factors contributing to disparities.

* ## Contents
**Data Analysis**: Insights derived from compiled income inequality data from various sources.
**Visualizations**: Interactive plots and charts illustrating income disparities across different countries and regions.
**Reports**: Detailed research papers and summaries analyzing trends, causes, and effects of income inequality.

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.7 or above is recommended.
- **Key Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `science`, `jupyter` must be installed alongside Python.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To run the analysis scripts.


* ## Conclusion
* The analysis highlights the distribution of income inequality across continents and years.
* Income inequality varies across different continents, with Africa and America showing higher levels of inequality.
* The dataset and analysis can contribute to understanding global income inequality trends and inform policy decisions.
