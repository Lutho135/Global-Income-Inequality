# Global Income Equality

## Introduction
Global Income Equality refers to the equitable distribution of income across different populations worldwide. It is a critical issue that affects economic stability, social cohesion, and overall human development.
This project aims to analyze and visualize the income distribution across different countries and regions to understand the level of of income inequality on a global scale.

## Current State of Global Income Inequality
Income inequality remains a significant challenge both between and within countries.

## Factors Contributing to Income Inequality
* Globalization: While it has lifted many out of poverty, globalization has also widened the gap between the rich and the poor2.
* Technological Advancements: Automation and digitalization have disproportionately benefited those with higher skills and capital.
* Policy Decisions: Tax policies, social welfare programs, and labor laws significantly impact income distribution.

 ## Tools Used
* Python: Used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
* Pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: Python libraries for creating visualizations of the income distribution data.
* Jupyter Notebook: Used for coding, data exploration, and collaboration among team members.

* ## Analysis
* We will conduct descriptive statistics to understand the income distribution within and across countries.
* We will create visualizations, such as bar plots and heatmaps, to illustrate the income distribution patterns.
* We will compare income inequality trends over time and across countries to identify potential factors contributing to disparities.

* ## Advanced Visualization
* Advanced visualizations, such as cluster maps, pair plots, swarm plots, and joint plots, were used to provide deeper insights into income inequality patterns.

* ## Conclusion
* The analysis highlights the distribution of income inequality across continents and years.
* Income inequality varies across different continents, with Africa and America showing higher levels of inequality.
* The dataset and analysis can contribute to understanding global income inequality trends and inform policy decisions.
