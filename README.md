# Global Income Equality

## Introduction
**Global Income Equality** is a data-driven project aimed at understanding and addressing disparities in income distribution across countries and regions. 
 Through data analysis, visualization, and policy insights, this project seeks to promote awareness and drive action toward a more equitable global economy

### üìù Project Overview

This notebook presents a comprehensive analysis of global income inequality using data science methodologies. The project examines income distribution patterns across multiple countries and time periods, employing statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to understand and predict economic disparities.

# üìä Global Income Inequality Analysis

## üìò Context and Background

Income inequality is a critical issue affecting economic stability, social cohesion, and development across the globe. It refers to the extent to which income is distributed unevenly among a population. High levels of inequality can lead to reduced economic growth, increased poverty, and social unrest.

This dataset provides a comprehensive view of income distribution across various countries and years. It includes key indicators such as:

- Country and Year  
- Population  
- Gini Index (a measure of income inequality)  
- Average Income (USD)  
- Income Share of the Top 10% and Bottom 10%  
- Income Group Classification  

## üéØ Aim of the Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to:

- Explore global trends in income inequality  
- Identify disparities between income groups  
- Understand how income is distributed across different countries and over time  
- Provide insights that can inform policy decisions and future research  

We will begin by cleaning and preprocessing the data, followed by statistical analysis and visualizations to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.

## Data Sources
The data used primarily stems from reputable international organizations, including:

* World Bank
* International Monetary Fund (IMF)
* United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
* OECD  

 ## Tools Used
* Python: Used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
* Pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: Python libraries for creating visualizations of the income distribution data.
* Jupyter Notebook: Used for coding, data exploration, and collaboration among team members.
* These organizations offer comprehensive, reliable statistics on various income indicators, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP).

* ## Analysis
* We will conduct descriptive statistics to understand the income distribution within and across countries.
* We will create visualizations, such as bar plots and heatmaps, to illustrate the income distribution patterns.
* We will compare income inequality trends over time and across countries to identify potential factors contributing to disparities.

* ## Contents
**Data Analysis**: Insights derived from compiled income inequality data from various sources.
**Visualizations**: Interactive plots and charts illustrating income disparities across different countries and regions.
**Reports**: Detailed research papers and summaries analyzing trends, causes, and effects of income inequality.

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.7 or above is recommended.
- **Key Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `science`, `jupyter` must be installed alongside Python.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To run the analysis scripts.


* ## Conclusion
* The analysis highlights the distribution of income inequality across continents and years.
* Income inequality varies across different continents, with Africa and America showing higher levels of inequality.
* The dataset and analysis can contribute to understanding global income inequality trends and inform policy decisions.
* The dataset provides valuable insights into global income inequality.
* Most countries have moderate Gini Index values, but some show extreme inequality.
* There is a visible relationship between average income and inequality.
* Countries with higher Gini Index tend to have lower income shares for the bottom 10%.
* Income inequality varies significantly across countries and over time.
